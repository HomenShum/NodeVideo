// a reference video is something it can watch and compare against, and every
// observation it makes then carries a timestamp into a real artifact.
//
// Set REFERENCE_VIDEOS to a comma-separated list of YouTube URLs to enable the
// comparison. Left empty by default: each reference costs ~100k prompt tokens,
// which is a real bill, and the calibration prose alone already moved the judge
// off uniform scoring.

CALIBRATE AGAINST THESE. They are the working bar, not aspirations.

  LINEAR        45-90s per reel. ONE job-to-be-done per video. Dark, dense, almost
                no narration. The changelog reads like a director's cut: a 30s
                walkthrough, then the technical detail. Nothing is explained twice.
  STRIPE        Under 90s. The API is the HERO -- code and payment flows are the
                motion, not decoration around a talking head. Technical viewers see
                the primitive; business viewers see the outcome. Same frames.
  VERCEL        The homepage demo is push-code -> watch-it-deploy. Brevity IS the
                message: it reproduces the aha moment rather than describing it.
  ARCADE        Cinematic polish as a floor, not a differentiator: smooth easing,
                deliberate zoom, no jump cuts between unrelated states.

THE GOVERNING RULE, from the same body of work:
  Identify the product's single most impressive moment and build the ENTIRE demo
  around it. If a first-time viewer's jaw drops inside 30 seconds, it works.

So when you score, ask specifically:
  - WHICH single moment is this demo built around? Name it and its timestamp. If you
    cannot find one, storyboard_clarity is 0 regardless of how polished the rest is.
  - Does that moment land inside the first 30s? If it is buried at the end behind
    setup, say so as a P1 with the timestamp it should move to.
  - Is every second before it EARNING that moment, or is it product tour filler?
  - Would LINEAR ship this length? If it is over 90s, justify every extra second or
    call it a defect.
  - Is the motion revealing evidence (Stripe: the API is the hero) or decorating a
    static screenshot?

  //    shrugging was quietly biasing the number it produced. It is now opt-in
