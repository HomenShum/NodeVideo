// The default loop: RENDER -> JUDGE -> REVISE -> re-render, until the gate passes
// or the round budget runs out.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE DEFAULT AND NOT AN EXTRA STEP.
//
// Every video this repo has produced was judged exactly once, by whoever
// remembered to run the judge, at the end, when the storyboard was already
// expensive to change. The predictable result: the judge's findings became
// release notes instead of edits. The TrialScope cut shipped at 20/40 -- craft
// 11, comprehension 9 -- and the comprehension half had never been measured at
// all, because nobody had thought to ask "did anyone understand it" as a
// separate question from "is it well made".
//
// A gate that runs once, after the work, is a grade. A gate that runs every
// round, before the work is called done, is a process. This file is the second
// thing. `npm run clip` goes through it; there is no shorter path that skips it.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately: it does not edit your storyboard for you.
// The judge's next_cut brief is written to disk as a revision brief and the
// process exits non-zero. A loop that auto-applied its own critic's notes would
// converge on whatever the critic likes, which is not the same as a good demo,
// and there would be no human or agent left holding the taste. Round N+1 starts
// when someone applies the brief.
