const RUBRIC = `You are judging a rendered product-walkthrough video (a feature demo with an
animated cursor, click ripples, step captions, and a progress bar — possibly with narration).
The quality bar is STORY-FIRST and ANTI-HERO-SHOT.

STAGE 1 — OBSERVE, before any judgement. Build a literal timeline of the video: one entry roughly
every 2-3 seconds, each {"ts":"m:ss","what":"exactly what is on screen and what changed"}. Record
motion, cursor position, state changes, text appearing, waits, audio events. If nothing changes,
say nothing changed. Do not evaluate anything in this stage.

STAGE 2 — SCORE, from the timeline only. Every score MUST cite the ts of one or more Stage 1
observations as its evidence. A score with no supporting observation is invalid — write 0 and say
"no observation supports more". Calibration anchors, and these are not negotiable:
  - a video where the timeline shows no state changes scores 0 on state_coverage, responsiveness
    and full_interaction, and 0 on cursor_truth if no cursor appears
  - a score of 1 means you can cite an observation where the thing HAPPENS but weakly; it is not a
    default for "probably fine"
  - use the full 0-2 range; if all your scores are identical, you have stopped observing

Score each dimension 0-2 (0=fails, 1=acceptable, 2=strong), each citing timeline entries:
1. storyboard_clarity - can a first-time viewer state what is being compared, why it matters, and what each scene proves?
2. state_coverage - does each flow show empty state -> action -> (loading if async) -> result, or does it skip to outcomes (hero-shot smell)?
3. cursor_truth - does the cursor visibly travel to and land ON the control being used before each state change?
4. caption_sync - do step captions match what is actually happening on screen (and any narration heard)?
5. pacing - can a first-time viewer read each caption and register each state? any dead air or rushed beats?
6. legibility - is app text readable at the rendered size? are captions large and contrasty enough?
7. proof_feel - does it read as evidence of a real working product (real states, real data motion) rather than staged marketing?
8. safety - any visible secrets, API keys, tokens, real personal data, or internal URLs that should not ship?
9. loop_etiquette - if this loops as a GIF, is the total length and final-state hold reasonable (viewers lost on the second loop = too long)?
10. motion_craft - do camera moves REVEAL evidence rather than decorate? Is the zoom-to-focus landing on the region the caption is talking about, held long enough to read, and eased rather than snapped? Any jitter, drift, competing simultaneous motion, or a move that ends somewhere the viewer did not need to look?
11. visual_hierarchy - at every moment, is exactly one thing asking for attention? Is the focused region actually distinguished (framing, scale, contrast, dimming of the rest) rather than merely centred? Does anything decorative compete with the evidence?

REFERENCE STANDARD. Score against how the best product demos actually work, not against
"a video was produced":
- ONE moment carries it. Vercel's demo is push code, watch it deploy — the aha lands in seconds and
  the brevity IS the message. Ask: what is THIS video's single moment, and does it arrive early?
- SPEED IS SHOWN, NOT CLAIMED. Linear's demo leans on the product being fast: issue creation,
  filtering and navigation happen visibly instantly, with the keystrokes and snappy transitions on
  screen. Latency edited out is a hero shot; latency shown and short is proof.
- COMPOUND VALUE reads as one conversation. Stripe's tour makes many capabilities feel like a single
  system rather than a feature list. A demo that is a tour of tabs has no thesis.
If the video has no identifiable single moment, say so as a P0 under storyboard_clarity — that is
the defect that makes a technically-correct walkthrough forgettable.

WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE, and must not claim. You are watching PIXELS. Three different things can be
true or false independently — what was INTENDED, what the RUNTIME actually did, and what a viewer
can SEE — and four mismatch classes live between them:
  intent-runtime      the thing that was supposed to happen never happened
  runtime-pixel       it happened but was never visible in frame
  pixel-experience    it was visible but framed or paced so the viewer cannot read it
  experience-interaction  it reads fine but a user could not actually reach or trigger it
You can only judge the last two. Never assert that a number is correct, that a backend really ran,
or that data is real — a convincing render of a fabricated result looks identical to a true one from
here. When a claim's truth depends on something off-screen, record it in defects with severity P1
and observed starting "unverifiable-from-video:" so a human knows to check it another way.

Then list DEFECTS: each with timestamp, severity (P0 blocks publishing / P1 fix before posting /
P2 polish, log and ship), what you observed, and a concrete fix.
Finally an overall verdict: publish | fix-then-publish | rework.

Judge the candidate on its own terms first — the scores and defects above are about video 1 only.
Then add a "reference" block comparing them on the axes that actually transfer:
  singleMoment      what is each reference built around, and how early does it land?
  statePacing       how long does a reference hold a state before moving on, in seconds?
  motionPurpose     when a reference moves the camera, what is it revealing?
  whatToSteal       one concrete, transferable technique, with a timestamp in the reference
  whatNotToSteal    something a reference does that would be dishonest for THIS product, and why

Cite a timestamp in the reference for every claim about it. "Their pacing is good" is not an
observation; "at 0:12 the loading state holds for about 1.4s before the result" is. If a reference
cannot be watched, say so in that block rather than describing it from memory.
